To demonstrate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and how it can be susceptible to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, I’ll outline the basic mechanics of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and then walk through a step-by-step example showing how a MITM attack could compromise it.

### Part 1: The Basics of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

The Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol allows two parties, traditionally named Sarvesh and Sam, to generate a shared secret key over an insecure channel without directly transmitting the key itself. Here’s how it works:

1. **Parameters Setup:**
   - Sarvesh and Sam agree on two large numbers:
     - A **prime number** ( p )
     - A **primitive root** modulo ( p ), denoted as ( g )
   
2. **Key Generation:**
   - Sarvesh chooses a **private key** ( a ) (random integer) and computes ( A = g^a mod p ).
   - Sam chooses a **private key** ( b ) (random integer) and computes ( B = g^b mod p ).
   
3. **Key Exchange:**
   - Sarvesh sends ( A ) to Sam, and Sam sends ( B ) to Sarvesh.

4. **Shared Secret Generation:**
   - Sarvesh computes the shared secret as ( S = B^a mod p ).
   - Sam computes the shared secret as ( S = A^b mod p ).
   - Because of the mathematical properties of modular exponentiation, both parties compute the same value ( S ), which can then be used as a shared secret key for symmetric encryption.

This process is secure if no third party can intercept or modify the values exchanged between Sarvesh and Sam.

### Part 2: Diffie-Hellman with Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack

In a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, an attacker (Hacker) intercepts and alters the communication between Sarvesh and Sam without them realizing it. Here’s how the attack might work:

1. **Hacker Intercepts the Exchange:**
   - When Sarvesh sends ( A = g^a mod p ) to Sam, Hacker intercepts ( A ).
   - Instead of passing ( A ) to Sam, Hacker sends her own calculated ( A_Hacker = g^h1 mod p ) to Sam, where ( e1 ) is Hacker’s private key.

2. **Hacker Modifies Sam’s Response:**
   - When Sam sends ( B = g^b mod p ) back to Sarvesh, Hacker intercepts ( B ).
   - Hacker then sends her own calculated ( B_Hacker = g^h2 mod p ) to Sarvesh, where ( e2 ) is another private key of Hacker.

3. **Separate Shared Keys Established:**
   - Sarvesh, believing she’s communicating with Sam, computes the shared secret ( S_Sarvesh = B_Hacker^a mod p ).
   - Sam, also believing he’s communicating with Sarvesh, computes the shared secret ( S_Sam = A_Hacker^b mod p ).
   - Meanwhile, Hacker has calculated two shared secrets:
     - With Sarvesh: ( S_{Hacker, Sarvesh} = A^e1 mod p )
     - With Sam: ( S_{Hacker, Sam} = B^e2 mod p )
   
   Since Hacker now has both secrets, she can decrypt and re-encrypt any messages between Sarvesh and Sam, making it appear as if they are communicating securely, while Hacker actually reads or modifies their messages.

### PrHackernting MITM in Diffie-Hellman

To prHackernt MITM attacks, Diffie-Hellman key exchange is often combined with authentication mechanisms, such as **digital signatures** or **public-key certificates**. These mechanisms help each party verify the identity of the other party, reducing the risk of a third party (like Hacker) intercepting and altering their communications undetected.
