Rough Roadmap

Signals
-----
Study on Linux (read man pages) system calls: signal(), kill(), raise(), sigprocmask(), pause(), 
Read 8th chapter from "Advanced programming in the Unix environment"
Write Enough number of C programs on Linux, to try the above system calls. Ensure that you undersand what signal handlers are, how to install them, how do they get invoked.
Try handling Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z using signal handlers.
Try programs involving sigprocmask() and check that the masking works.
Draw many diagrams involving the code path of trap-handling and trap return, also struct proc and all the data structures related to proc.
Learn thoroughly what happens on user stack, kernel stack, and the calling convention. 
Significant: Try to work out the control flow of code of signal() and kill() and runnning the signal handler and returning from signal handler into user code.
Start suggesting changes to 'struct proc' and user-stack and/or kernel-stack.
Implement your syscalls.
