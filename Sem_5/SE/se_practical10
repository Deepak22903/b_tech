Title - Cmake
  make bubble sort program and build using cmake


  Cmake is an open source, cross platform build system generator. It is used to manage the build processes in a platform independent way.
  Cmake generates native build files for a paticular system. Allowing you to compile you code on different platform without modifing the project configuration.
  Features of Cmake:
    -Out of source builds
    -Allows building binaries in a directories separate from the source code, keeping the source code tree clean
    -Cross-platform support (Works on linux, MacOS, Windows and other)
    -Automatic dependance management, Cmake handles dependencies between files and models automatically
    -Support of custom targets, Cmake allows adding custom commands and targets to the building process 
    -Modular configuration, with Cmake scripting language you can split complex builds into modular files

  Basic workflow of Cmake:
    -Create a cmake list (e.g- cmakelist.txt) that describes the project and its requirements
    -Run Cmake to generate native build files (Structure-
                                                  cmake[<path to source>])
    -Build using the generated build files (command = make or cmake --build .)
