Principles of Reliable Data Transfer
rdt1.0 – A protocol for a completely reliable channel
rdt2.0 – A protocol for a channel with bit errors
rdt2.1 -( positive and negative acknowledgments from the receiver to the sender).
rdt2.2 - (the receiver must now include the sequence number of the packet being acknowledged by an ACK message)
rdt3.0 - a protocol that reliably transfers data over a channel that can corrupt or lose packets
Stop-and-wait protocol
Stop-and-wait versus pipelined protocol
